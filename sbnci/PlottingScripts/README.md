Plotting Scripts
================

This directory contains the scripts that produce physics plots from the metrics stored in the analysis `TTree`s.

It also contains the `CompareDataDistributions.C` script which compares each plot to a reference version 
and calculates a chi-squared value to represent how well they agree.
