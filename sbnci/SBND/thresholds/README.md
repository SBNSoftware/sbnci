thresholds
==========

This directory contains text files with chi-squared thresholds for the plot comparisons in 
each validation. Each plot is given two thresholds, this defines "good", "okay" and "bad"
agreement. These scales are also used to colour code the chi-squared tables and the plots
on the CI dashboard.
